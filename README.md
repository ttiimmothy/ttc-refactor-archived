## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the work of the original authors of [ttc-bus-eta](https://github.com/thomassth/ttc-bus-eta). While this project is not a direct continuation of their work, it would not have been possible without their initial contributions. We would like to extend our thanks to them for providing a foundation upon which we could build this project.
